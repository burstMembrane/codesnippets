                <p> Liam Power is a multidisciplinary artist based in Melbourne, Australia. While playing in bands around Melbourne, Liamâ€™s interests in sonic experimentation grew from sticky stages to gallery walls. His work has played on jail gates, streamed to surround installations and engulfed suburban bedrooms. He is currently experimenting with the boundaries and weaknesses of systems. These systems could be tape machines, computer algorithms, or his own brain. He is currently studying a Bachelor of Fine Art at RMIT University.
