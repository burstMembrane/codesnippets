00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:07.680
Once embodied in the power of workers councils, a power destined to supplant all the other powers worldwide

2
00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:10.496
the proletarian movement becomes its own product.

3
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.104
This product is the producer himself and in his own eyes the producer himself

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.896
has himself as his goal

5
00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:21.504
Only in this context can the Spectacle's negation of life be negated in its turn

6
00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:30.720
The Spectacle is not a collection of images rather it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images

7
00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:43.264
The Spectacle is not a collection of images rather it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by

8
00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:43.264
images

9
00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:49.920
The Spectacle cannot be understood either as a deliberate distortion of the visual world or as a product of the technology of the mass 

10
00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:51.200
dissemination of images

11
00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:55.040
Is far better viewed as a weltanschauung that has been actualized

12
00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:57.088
translated into the material realm

13
00:00:57.344 --> 00:01:00.160
a world view transformed into an objective Force

14
00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:07.072
The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense 

15
00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:08.608
accumulation of spectacles

16
00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:12.448
All that once was directly lived has become a mere representation

17
00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:17.056
Images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream

18
00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:19.872
and the former unity of life Is lost forever

19
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:25.504
Apprehended in a partial way, reality unfolds in a new generality as a pseudo world apart

20
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.808
solely as an object of contemplation

21
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.464
the tendency towards the specialisation of images of the world finds it's highest expression in the world of the autonomous image

22
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.768
where deceit deceives itself 

23
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.168
The Spectacle in its generality is a concrete inversion of life and as such the autonomous movement of non-life

24
00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.752
The Spectacle appears

25
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:48.800
at once as society itself

26
00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:50.592
as a part of society

27
00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:52.384
and as a means of unification

28
00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:58.016
As a part of society it is that sector where all attention, all consciousness converges

29
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:04.160
Being isolated and precisely for that reason this sector is the locus of illusion and false consciousness

30
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:08.000
The unity it imposes is merely the official language of generalized

31
00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:09.024
speculation

32
00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:22.592
The Spectacle appears at once as society itself, as a part of society, and as a means of unification

33
00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:27.456
As a part of society it is that sector where all attention, all consciousness converges

34
00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:33.600
Being isolated and precisely for that reason this sector is the locus of illusion and false consciousness

35
00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:38.208
The unity it imposes is merely the official language of generalized speculation

36
00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:48.192
The phenomenon of separation is part and parcel of the unity of the world, of a global social praxis that is split

37
00:02:48.448 --> 00:02:51.008
up into reality on the one hand and image on the other

38
00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:54.592
Social practice which the Spectacles autonomy challenges

39
00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:58.688
Is also the real totality to which the Spectacle is subordinate

40
00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:04.320
So deep is the rift in this totality however the Spectacle is able to emerge as its apparent goal

41
00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:09.440
The language of the Spectacle is composed of the signs of dominant organisation of production

42
00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:13.792
signs which are at the same time the ultimate end products of that organisation

43
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:22.240
The Spectacle cannot be set in abstract opposition to concrete social activity, for the dichotomy between reality and image will

44
00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.056
survive on either side of any such distinction

45
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:28.384
Thus the Spectacle, although it turns reality on his head

46
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.688
is itself a product of real activity

47
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:36.576
Likewise lived reality suffers the material assualtss of the Spectacles mechanisms of contemplation

48
00:03:36.832 --> 00:03:40.672
incorporating the spectacular order and lending that order positive support

49
00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:44.000
rach side therefore has its share of objective reality

50
00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:47.328
and every concept as it takes it's place on one side or the other

51
00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:50.912
has no foundation apart from its transformation into it's opposite

52
00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:54.240
reality erupts within the Spectacle and the Spectacle is real

53
00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:59.616
This reciprocal alienation is the essence and underpinning of society as it exists

54
00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:06.016
In a world that really has been turned on it's head, truth is a moment of falsehood
